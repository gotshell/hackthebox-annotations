MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. Instead of using tables and rows like in traditional
relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Each database contains
collections which in turn further contain documents. Each document consists of key-value pairs which are
the basic unit of data in a MongoDB database. A single collection can contain multiple documents and they
are schema-less meaning that the size and content of each document can be different from each another.
